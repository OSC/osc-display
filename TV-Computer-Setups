-Account setup to automatically run an apple script app (see zip file in this folder) that starts Chrome and presses Control-Apple-F to get into full screen kiosk mode

-Each HTM file automatically loads for 5 seconds then refreshes by loading the next file
-Mac Mini and LG TV setup via system preferences to power off at 6PM and on at 7:30AM weekdays
-LG TVs have the 2 hour auto-power off disabled via the service menu. Info on doing that is available here: http://openlgtv.org.ru/wiki/index.php/Access_hidden_service_menus_/_modes - Here are the steps:
1) You need:
- Android smartphone with Infrared
- Android APP "Smart IR Remote Anymote" from google play  Smart IR Remote - AnyMote -
2) Open app, create a new remote: TV -> LG brand -> "SERVICE REMOTE" type -> press the "use internal android IR device" button.
3) Aim with smartphone infrared emiter to infrared receiver of the TV and press "IN_START" in the virtual remote.
4) It will ask a password, which is "0413". IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TYPE THIS PASSWORD WITH ORIGINAL MAGIC REMOTE.
4) You will access the LG service hidden menu. Inside that menu, go to "system 1" and change the "2 hours off (On timer)" setting to off.
